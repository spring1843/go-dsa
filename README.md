Welcome to **Data Structures and Algorithms in Go**! 🎉 This project is designed to serve as a dynamic, hands-on learning resource for exploring data structures and algorithms using the Go programming language. We aim to provide practical, executable content for learners seeking to deepen their understanding in these critical areas of computer science.

* It's executable across different platforms, reducing potential errors in the provided solutions.
* It provides 100% test coverage for all problems, ensuring the accuracy of every solution.
* It's continuously evolving and improving, thanks to contributions and reviews from the community.
* It lets you practice in your preferred programming environment, offering convenience and flexibility.
* It's completely free, making advanced knowledge in this field accessible to everyone.

To run examples locally [install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install), and run `go get -u github.com/spring1843/go-dsa`.

## 📋 Outline

For each topic, we strive to provide a comprehensive README.md file and at least 5 solved problems. Each README.md will contain:

* 💡 **Implementation**: Detailed explanation on how the data structure or algorithm can be implemented, including code examples in Go.
* 📊 **Complexity**: Analysis of the time and space complexity of the data structure or algorithm.
* 🎯 **Application**: Discussion of problems that are commonly solved using the data structure or algorithm.
* 📝 **Rehearsal**: Practice problems with links to tests that provide 100% coverage, and example inputs and outputs.
