## üõ†Ô∏è How to use

* Read the README.md file of each subject.
* Solve the rehearsal problems.
* Read the problem description.
* Copy the contents of each `*_test.go` file into [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/).
* Change the first line from `package SOME_PACKAGE_NAME` to `package main`.
* Look at the sample input in the `*_test.go` file.

* Review the provided solution and compare it to your own.

## üìã Outline

For each topic, we strive to provide a comprehensive README.md file and at least 5 solved problems. Each README.md will contain:

* üí° **Implementation**: Detailed explanation on how the data structure or algorithm can be implemented, including code examples in Go.
* üìä **Complexity**: Analysis of the time and space complexity of the data structure or algorithm.
* üéØ **Application**: Discussion of problems that are commonly solved using the data structure or algorithm.
* üìù **Rehearsal**: Practice problems with links to tests that provide 100% coverage, and example inputs and outputs.
