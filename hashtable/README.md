# Hash Table

## Rehearsal

### Find Missing Number

Given an unsorted array of numbers like {7,5,3,4,1,2,0,-1} return the missing integer like 6. [Solution](missing_number.go) [Test](missing_number.go)

### List Elements Summing Up to K

Given a list, output the indices of the first two elements that sum up to K. [Solution](sum_up_to_k.go) [Test](sum_up_to_k_test.go)

### Fastest Way to Cut a Brick Wall

Given a two dimensional array of numbers representing the length of each brick in each row of a wall, return the position at which we could do the least amount of cuts (by not having to cut the touch points where bricks meet). [Solution](cut_brick_wall.go) [Test](cut_brick_wall_test.go)

### Find Anagrams

Given a dictionary, return lists of words that are anagrams of each other. [Solution](find_anagrams.go), [Tests](find_anagrams_test.go)

### Find Max Lines on the Same Line

Given multiple coordinates of points like {[1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,5]}, return the maximum number of points that are on the same lane like 3. [Solution](max_lines_on_line.go) [Test](max_lines_on_line_test.go)
