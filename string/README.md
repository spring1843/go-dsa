## Rehearsal

### The longest Dictionary Word Containing Key

Given a key like "car", and a dictionary like {"rectify", "race", "archeology", "racoon"} return the longest dictionary word that contains every letter of the key like "archeology". [Solution](longest_dictionary_word.go), [Tests](longest_dictionary_word_test.go)

### Look and Tell

Given a depth, return the output of look and tell an algorithm where each line reads the last line. For example "1" is read as "11" (one one), and "11" is read as "21" (two ones). [Solution](look_and_tell.go), [Tests](look_and_tell_test.go)

### In Memory Database

Write an in memory database that stores string key value pairs and supports SET, GET, EXISTS, and UNSET commands. It should also allow transactions with BEGIN, COMMIT and ROLLBACK commands. [Solution](in_memory_database.go), [Tests](in_memory_database_test.go)

### Number in English

Given a number like 34, return how the number  would be read in English e.g. (Thirty Four) for integers smaller than one Trillion. [Solution](number_in_english.go), [Tests](number_in_english_test.go)

### Reverse Vowels In a String

Given a string e.g. "coat", reverse the order in which vowels appear e.g. "caot". [Solution](reverse_vowels.go), [Tests](reverse_vowels_test.go)

### Longest Substring of Two Unique Characters

Given a string like "aabbc" return the longest substring of two unique characters like "aabb". [Solution](longest_substring.go), [Test](longest_substring_test.go)
