TestEmployeeHeadCount tests solution(s) with the following signature and problem description:

	HeadCount(employeeID int) int

Headcount of a person in an organization is 1 + the number of all their reports
(direct and indirect). Given a list of employee IDs and their direct reports in each line like
`1,4,5`, `5,7`, `4`, `7`. Where 1 has two direct reports (4 and 5); 5 has one report (7);
4 and 5 have no reports; Return the headcount of a given employee ID. For example head
count of 7 is 1, and headcount of 1 is 4.
