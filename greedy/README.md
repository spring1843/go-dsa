### Activity Selector

Given a list of start and finish times for a few activities like `{1, 3, 0}` and `{4, 5, 6}` (first activity starts at 1 and ends at 4, second starts at 3 and ends at 5), return a maximal list of non-conflicting activities. [Solution](activity_selector.go), [Tests](activity_selector_test.go)
