TestRodCutting tests solution(s) with the following signature and problem description:

	CutRod(prices []int, n int) int

Given a list containing price a table such as {1,5,8,9,10} indicating the price of
a rod of a given length (1 inch rod is $1, 2 inch rod is $5, 5 inch rod is $10) and
number n like 3, indicating the length of a given rod, calculate maximum revenue that
can be earned by cutting the rod and selling the pieces when cutting is free.
