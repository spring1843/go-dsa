# Trees

## Rehearsal

### Serialize Binary Tree

Write two functions to serialize and unserialize a binary tree like (B) in _Figure 2_ to and from a string like `4,2,6,nil,3,5,nil`. [Solution](serialize_tree.go), [Test](serialize_tree_test.go)

### Evaluate A Binary Expression Tree

Given an expression binary tree like (D) in _Figure2_ evaluate it to a float64 like 100. [Solution](evaluate_expression.go), [Test](evaluate_expression_test.go)

### Sorted Array to Balanced BST

Given a sorted array of integers like {1,2,3,4,5} return the root to a balanced BST.  [Solution](sorted_array_to_balanced_bsd.go), [Test](sorted_array_to_balanced_bsd_test.go)

### Traverse Binary Tree

Given a binary tree like _figure 1_, write three functions to traverse the tree in-order, pre-order, and post-order. [Solution](traverse_binary_tree.go), [Test](traverse_binary_tree_test.go)

### Implement Autocomplete

Given a word like "car" and a dictionary like {"car","caravan","card","carpet","cap","ca"}, return auto complete suggestions where the given word is the prefix of a dictionary word like {"avan","d","pet"}. [Solution](auto_complete.go), [Test](auto_complete_test.go)
