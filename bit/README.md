# Bit Manipulation

## Rehearsal

### Division without multiplication or division operators

Divide x by y, two integers without using the built-in `/` or `*` operators.  [Solution](division_without_operators.go), [Tests](division_without_operators_test.go)

### Middle without division

Given two integers min and max like `1` and `5`, return an integer like `3` that is in the middle of the two. [Solution](middle_without_division.go), [Tests](middle_without_division_test.go)

### Addition without using any operators

Add x by y, two integers without using the built-in + or any other operators. [Solution](addition_without_operators.go), [Tests](addition_without_operators_test.go)

### Maximum without if conditions

Write max, a function that returns the largest of two numbers without using a comparison or if conditions. [Solution](max_function_without_conditions.go), [Tests](max_function_without_conditions_test.go)

### Oddly Repeated Number

Given an array of integers that are all repeated an even number of times except one, find the oddly repeated element. [Solution](oddly_repeated_number.go), [Tests](oddly_repeated_number_test.go)
