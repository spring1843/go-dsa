TestMiddleWithoutDivision tests solution(s) with the following signature and problem description:

	func MiddleWithoutDivision(min, max int)

Given two integers return the integer that is in the middle of the two integers without
using any arithmetic operators such as {+,-,/,*,++,--,+=,â€¦}.

For example given 1 and 5, return 3. This is because 3 is in the middle of integers 1 to 5.
