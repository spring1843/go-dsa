TestExpressionOperators tests solution(s) with the following signature and problem description:

	func ExpressionOperators(list []int, target int) string

Given a list of numbers representing operands in an equation, and a target integer representing
the result of the equation, return a string representing operators that can be inserted between
the operands to form the equation and yield the target result.
Only + and - operators are allowed and the are assumed to have the same priority

For example given {1,5,3} and 3, it should return +- because 1+5-3 = 3.
