## Permutations

Given a list of integers like `{1,2}`, produce all possible combinations like `{1,2},{2,1}`. [Solution](permutations.go), [Tests](permutations_test.go)

### Generate Parenthesis

Write a function that intakes an integer n, and produces all valid variations of arranging n pair of parenthesis. e.g. for `2` it should return `()()` and `(())`. [Solution](generate_parenthesis.go), [Tests](generate_parenthesis_test.go)

### Phone Letter Combinations

Write a function that intakes a string of digits from 2 to 9 inclusive and returns all possible combinations of letters that could be generated from those. For example for input `2` it should return `abc`. [Solution](phone_letter_combinations.go), [Tests](phone_letter_combinations_test.go)

### Sudoku

Given a partially filled 9x9 grid with integers from 1 to 9 representing a Sudoku board and 0 representing an empty slot that needs to be filled, write a function that solves the board such that the values in each row, column and each of the 9 3x3 sub-grids are unique. [Solution](sudoku.go), [Tests](sudoku_test.go)### Sudoku

### N Queens

Given an integer n representing an n by n chessboard, return all possible arrangements of placing n queens on the chessboard such that the queens do not attack each other. [Solution](n_queens.go), [Tests](n_queens_test.go)
